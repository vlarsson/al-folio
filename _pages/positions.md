### PhD student positions
I am looking for talented students (PhD/MSc) who are interested in doing exciting research in computer vision, geometry and machine learning.


## ELLIIT PhD position (April 2023)
The project is about developing 3D mapping methods which are used to enable re-localization and navigation in large-scale environments. In particular, we will focus on sparse reconstruction methods which takes as input is a set of images and produces a map consisting of a 3D point cloud. In the scope of the project, we will develop new methods both for establishing inter-image correspondences and for leveraging them in pipelines for localization and mapping. The target applications are in Structure-from-Motion (SfM), Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and visual localization. The position is fully-funded and the project is financed by the strategic research area [ELLIIT](https://www.elliit.se) and is part of the project “Revisiting data associations in large-scale mapping”, that runs 2023-2027 as a joint project between Lund and Linköping.

Note that the subject area for the PhD is mathematics and applicants will need to take math courses during their PhD studies. Please contact me for more details.

Apply [here](https://lu.varbi.com/en/what:job/jobID:602187/). (Deadline 23 April 2023)
