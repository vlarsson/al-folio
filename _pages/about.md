I am an Assistant Professor at the [Centre for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.maths.lu.se/english/) at [Lund University](https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/) working in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Previously I worked as a PostDoc and senior researcher at the [Computer Vision and Geometry group](https://cvg.inf.ethz.ch) lead by [Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/pomarc/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch)

My research is mainly focused on robust estimation problems that appear in 3D computer vision (e.g. Structure-from-Motion, visual localization, SLAM, and dense geometry estimation). Currently I am exploring how to best integrate deep learning with classical geometry-based pipelines. In particular, identifying and replacing hand-crafted heuristics or implicit assumptions with more data-driven alternatives.

**I am looking for talented students (PhD/MSc) who are interested in doing exciting research in computer vision, geometry and machine learning.**
